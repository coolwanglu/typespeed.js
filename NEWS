typespeed v0.6.5

- A memory management bug has been fixed which resulted in a segmentation
  fault if a wordlist with more than 1024 words has been selected.
- The order of high score entries can be specified in configuration file,
  so you can decide if correctness is more important than speed etc.
- With this version, you are able to reach 0 % typo ratio even if you were
  not able to complete your last word before game end.

typespeed v0.6.4

- A division by zero bug has been fixed in network code.  This one could
  occure with specialy crafted packets, so normal game play was not
  affected.  No security problem, just a reliability fix.
- Words per minute have been added, tCPS have been dropped.  You can
  still calculate tCPS on your own, high score file format is specified
  in README.

typespeed v0.6.3

- Major improvements in network code. This was _realy_ necessary for a
  long time, I think this code should work.  Maybe there are some little
  glitches in it, but the core logic is much simpler, saner, and more
  stable than in 0.6.2 and before. To make debugging even simpler, a
  new option called "--netlog=file" has been added: it writes all data
  read/sent through network into that file.  Yes, typespeed's network
  code is _that_ simple. :)
- Menus can be left with Escape now. Lack of this "feature" was not
  acceptable anymore.
- On multi user systems it might have been quite annoying to never see
  the personal record on top10, just because people were better.  Now it
  is possible to scroll through high score list.

typespeed v0.6.2

- Many many bug fixes have been made, most of these bugs have been
  introduced with 0.6.1. If you don't have any good reason to stick at
  0.6.1, please upgrade!  Perhaps you have an even older version: in that
  case, upgrade too. :)
- You can change directory for typespeed's documents (README) with --docdir.
- If you don't like to have typespeed's system wide high score file under
  localstatedir/games, you can change this during configure:
    --with-highscoredir=DIR

typespeed v0.6.1

- Finally the switch to autotools happened. And this definitely had to
  be done for nifty cool things like gettext and proper drop of
  privileges.
- Support for gettext has been included. If you would like to see
  typespeed in your (currently not supported) preferred language, put
  your hands on po/typespeed.pot and mail your new translations.
- Anticheat measurements are added to typespeed. On some systems it was
  very easy to copy whole screen and pasting it. Now you will lose
  immediately all your points as you deserve it - cheater! :)

typespeed v0.6.0

- A new mechanism for game rules has been integrated. With these
  game rules, you can change the way typespeed works.
- The high score file format has yet changed again: this time a
  csv format is in use. Also there is only one huge file that contains
  all game results (not just top 10). Especially usefull if you want
  to create statistics about your improvements. :)
- The binary is setgid games now, but drops privileges as soon as
  high score file is opened. With this step, there is no need any longer
  to create world writeable high score files.
