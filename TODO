Some ideas what we have got (in no special order)
-------------------------------------------------

* different multiplayer types?
* multiplayer uses random to send words, should it just send 1:2 of
  the words, or something?
* support for utf8 / switch to utf8
* IPv6 support
* network compatibility for older typespeed versions
* documentation (comments, handbook(?), etc.)
* color support should be more useful (i.e. use red for words a player
  can't finish with his current cps rate)

If you think those ideas are nice, implement them and send patch/source
or what ever to us, then they will be most likely added to typespeed. :)
