1 Requirements
--------------

In order to compile typespeed, your system must fulfill the following
requirements.

1.1 Supported Plattforms
------------------------

On the following plattforms, typespeed is known to work with at least
one operating system listed in 1.2:

- i386
- mipsel
- x86_64

1.2 Supported Operating Systems
-------------------------------

The following operating systems have been tested with typespeed.
Due to limited resources, not every release can be tested with every
operating system version.

- Cygwin
- FreeBSD
- GNU/Linux (various distributions)
- Mac OS X
- OpenBSD
- Windows

1.3 Needed Software
-------------------

You need a working toolchain for c programs (i.e. c compiler and
linker). Development and tests are done with gcc and binutils.
Other compilers might work, too.

Please use GNU make in order to build typespeed. Issues are known with
other make implementations.

Next to this your system must provide common header files.  If you use
a linux distribution, these could be supplied with packages ending in
-dev (e.g. libc-dev).

The last requirement is a curses library with corresponding header
files.  Most systems are shipped with different curses implementations.

To give an overview, these packages are used for development
(GNU/Linux system running on x86_64):

name          | minimum version known to work | used version
--------------+-------------------------------+--------------
autoconf      | 2.59                          | 2.62
automake      | 1.9                           | 1.10.1
binutils      | 2.7                           | 2.17
gcc           | 2.95.2                        | 4.2.1
glibc         | 2.2.2                         | 2.7
make (GNU)    | 3.79.1                        | 3.81
ncurses       | 4.0                           | 5.6

2 Installing Typespeed
----------------------

Please note that your system should have a group called "games".

If you do not want to change any default settings, simply type in the
following commands in top directory (do not type #):

# ./configure && make all install

3 File Structure
----------------

If you have installed typespeed without supplying configure options, the
following files and directories will be created:

/usr/local/bin/typespeed
/usr/local/etc/typespeedrc
/usr/local/share/doc/typespeed/README
/usr/local/share/man/man6/typespeed.6
/usr/local/share/typespeed/rules/ (contains game rules)
/usr/local/share/typespeed/words/ (contains word lists)
/usr/local/var/games/typespeed.score

Additionaly, if your system supports i18n, the following files will be
installed which contain menu translations:

/usr/local/share/locale/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/typespeed.mo
/usr/local/share/locale/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/typespeed.mo
/usr/local/share/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/typespeed.mo
