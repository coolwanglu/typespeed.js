# I think the most important tweak: adjust the misses limit.
# Allowed numbers: 0 .. 99

misses = 10

# With the next two lines you can set the length of the used words.
# This can be useful if you want to disable very long or very short
# words in your wordfile. The smallest word length is 1, the highest
# possible value for min and max is 19.

min word length = 1
max word length = 19

# These values define the minimum and maximum number of words that are
# shown at the same time. If you are a very fast typer, you should
# increase the min words value so you can type all the time. This
# should result in a better cps. Minimum is 1, maximum is 22.

min words = 1
max words = 22

# You can adjust your highscore file with these values. highscore can
# have two possible values:
# no  - do not create a highscore entry
# yes - allow highscore entries
#
# min score is the minimal score a player has to achieve to be listed
# in your highscore. Without this barrier, a player could enter one
# word correct and flood your highscore (much easier).

highscore = yes
min score = 0

# Rate adjustment. The formula behind typespeed's speed increasement:
#
# rate = score / step + minspeed;
#
# The rate specifies how often words will be moved per second.
# Each step, the rate will be increased by one, the default is 175.
# A step cannot be smaller than 1.

step = 175

# These settings adjust the overall game speed. The min speed will be
# the speed at the beginning of the game, max speed will be the
# highest possible speed. Setting min and max speed to the same value
# results in a steady game flow. The slowest possible speed is 1.
#
# Setting max speed to 0 deactivates a speed barrier.

min speed = 3
max speed = 0

# This setting defines the smoothness of speed increasement. Older
# typespeed versions (< 0.6.0) used an integer division instead of
# float precision. Option "yes" remedies this bug. Only for backwards
# compatibility (i.e. for users of typespeed < 0.6.0).

smooth = yes
